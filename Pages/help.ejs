            <p class="lead">
                Thank you for using Solar project, the best guide for solar projects for everyone. To begin your
                journey, on the home page you need to click on one of
                the buttons, whethere you are an ivestor or a solar engineer. Currently, the part of the application for
                investors is under construction, so the only active part is for investors.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Investor parameters</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                As an investor, you need to provide us only two parameters, location and average monthly consuption.
                Of course, in solar projecting, there are a few more parameters, but we take most common values for
                them, to make you easier.
                To choose the location, you need to fist click on the search button which is placed on the map.
            </p>
            <img src="Picture1.png" class="pic-center">
            <p class="lead">
                Once you click on the search button, you can start typing your location. While you are typing, a menu
                will appear with suggestions. You need to type until you find your location on the menu. When you find
                it, just click on it and you are done. Map is very detailed and has a huge number of toponyms, feel free
                to try.
            </p>
            <img src="Picture2.png" class="pic-center">
            <p class="lead">
                When you click on the desired loaction on the menu, a marker on map will appear which shows it. You can
                at this point move forward.
            </p>
            <img src="Picture3.png" class="pic-center">
            <p class="lead">
                One more thing you need to provide us is your average monthly energy consuption. The best option would
                be to sum up your annual consumption and divide it by 12, but it is not neccessary. After that, you need
                just to click on the "Calculate my system" button and you are done.
            </p>
            <img src="Picture4.png" class="pic-center">
            <h2 class="mt-5">Results analysis</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Results can be divided on three parts: Number of panels, invertor suggestion and cost of installation.
                All
                expenses are then summed and showed on the screen.
                Required number of panels are showed in table like on picture below. We show required number for mostly
                used
                type of panels. Table shows how many of those types are needed to cover up your annual consumption.
            </p>
            <img src="Picture5.png" class="pic-center">
            <p class="lead">
                So, from the table, you need to 23 panels with power rating 350 Wp or 19 450Wp panels or 15 550Wp
                panels.
